* The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.
We make requests and get responses every day in our life, so Let's take a look on what is happening behind the scence 



1. clients: Generally, clients are web browsers, but clients can also be APIâ€™s making requests to another server
2. What is an HTTP request?A HTTP request is a text string generated by the client and sent to the server containing the specifications of the resource the client is asking for.
3.  The HTTP request communicates which resource a client wants to interact with and how the client wants to interact with it, along with some metadata held in the header related to the request.

4. if a user entered http://twitter.com into their web browser, the web browser would send a request to the server looking for the Twitter resource.

5. server is a computer that never shut down (Netlify, Github pages)


- Let is say you linked a website and I open to open it, I will send a request with this linked, in the browser when I hit enter, I will send a request, and get my favorite website as a response
